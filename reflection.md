###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned you cannot add color to margins. I found that sizing margins using percentages helped keep everything centered and even looking on the page. Sounds silly, but I realized I had to make sure the width percentage of the page was the difference between 100% and the % the margins are taking up. When I did this, the margins resize if the browser window is resized and maintain the same percentages. Padding helps make an element appear larger and is transparent, so will take on whatever color the element already is. I experimented with dotted and solid borders to contain certain elements.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?
In order to change something's position, you have to position it - it cannot remain static. Once you change a position to relative, you can utilize the top, bottom, left, and right properties. I didn't utilize fixed positioning because there wasn't anything I wanted to remain in the same place relative to the browser window, I wanted everything to scroll with the page.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest things to change were colors, fonts, and sizing of elements. I was able to download a new font and add it as a stylesheet. The hardest was positioning things. It took many tries to center and make everything appear even in the frame. I had to experiment many times and use DevTools to see how certain things would affect positioning.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that I could remove bullet points from unordered lists by adjusting the list-style-type: none. Centering things is done by changing display to block and margin: auto. I found it was much easier to assign classes and styling those instead of styling the element directly. I found this kept everything cleaner and more organized because I could directly point to where a certain styling was coming from. I also learned that you can apply multiple css stylesheets to one page. The sheet listed last will override the first.
