<h2>Week Four: Don't Stop Beliebin'</h2>
<h4>January 21, 2016</h4>

<p>Bieber has come a long way since his 2014 arrest in Miami (pictured above). To honor his growth as a human and maturation as an artist, I’ve decided to explore the differences between arrays and hashes using some of his recent chart-topping hits. Okay that was a weird segue, how about this: For those of you saying “What Do You Mean” when you hear someone say the word array or hash, you’re going to “Love Yourself” after reading this blog and figuring it out! Alright, come along on this journey with Justin and me.</p>

<h4>Array</h4>
<p>Let’s create an array to store Justin Bieber’s newest hits.</p>
<rubycode>
bieber_fever = [“Sorry”, “What Do You Mean”, “Where Are &Uuml; Now”, “Love Yourself”]
</rubycode>
<p>To access a song in this array, I’d have to figure out which index it’s at. Each song is in order, starting with 0. Because the first value is at index 0, I’d have to count, 0…1…2… and finally 3 to find that “Love Yourself” is at index 3. I’d access this with the syntax bieber_fever[3].</p>
<code>
bieber_fever[3] = “Love Yourself"
</code>
<h4>Hash</h4>
<p>If I were to create a hash of Bieber’s newest hits, I could store each one in a something called a key that gives a little more information about what the song means to me. In the example above, the key is the description that comes before the arrow. In this hash, the song is the value.</p>
<code>
bieber_fever = {
     “best to dance to" => “Sorry”,
     “largest deviation from Bieber’s normal music" => “Where Are U Now”,
     “catchiest” => "What Do You Mean”,
     “most offensive to Selena Gomez" => “Love Yourself"
}
</code>
<p>So, instead of counting down to find a song’s index, we can easily choose a song by using the key associated with it. To find “Love Yourself” here, I’d just have to type:</p>
<code>
bieber_fever[“most offensive to Selena Gomez”]
</code>
<p>No annoying counting from 0 involved!</p>
<h4>Why use one over the other?</h4>
<p>Hashes are great for things that don’t need to be ordered. Since all four of these Bieber jams are undeniable hits, I have no interest in ranking them in any order like an array implies. With the hash, we can store all four songs with no implied order and assign keys that really describe each unique sound.</p>
<h4>Bottom Line:</h4>
<p>If you want to assign values to something other than integers, use a hash. If you have many values, it is easier to call one by it’s key than by its index (which you have to count manually).</p>
