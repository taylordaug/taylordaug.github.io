- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I am getting used to the elements common to every HTML site - the doctype tag, opening and closing html tags, head, title, body, etc. It is really starting to stick since these tags are common to most pages!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We researched the "section" tag, which we read is often used for blog posts, so we thought that was important to include. It looks like this will become important if we decide to have a blog with all posts on one page, then we can separate out each post with the appropriate title/header using the "section" tag. The "horizontal rule" element comes in handy for horizontal lines to break apart sections of the blog as well. Using different headers will allow for a clear hierarchy of information to the reader.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I still have no experimented with formatting in HTML since I don't know how and am waiting to learn how in CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Again, it is tough to remember to close each tag and make sure they are nested appropriately. It seems very simple to use and quick for setting up websites.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always start with the doctype command, followed by html, head, body, and whatever paragraphs you need. I am still reading about and researching different semantic tags that can be useful.
